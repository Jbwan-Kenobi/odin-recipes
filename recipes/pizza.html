    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup lukewarm water</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water that's 110 degrees F (44 degrees C) in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>

        <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup flour if dough is too sticky.</li>
        <li>Roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a greased pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Add your favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>Top crust as desired and bake at 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) until golden, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
